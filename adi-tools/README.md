*ADI Tools*

This is a set of PowerShell scripts and backing library to manipulate ADI metadata files.

**Requirements:**

PowerShell 6.x or above (Tested on 7.0.0 Preview 5 on Mac and 6.2.2 on Ubuntu)

**Recommended:**

Visual Studio Code with PowerShell extension from Microsoft

**Getting Started:**

This sample wrapper script expects to start with a single folder of ADI files with no directory structure.

Review 1-Process-Assets.ps1, update folder paths, remove/rearrange scripts as necessary, and run.

Or update variables in any of the script building blocks and execute any one step (such as updating license window, etc.)
